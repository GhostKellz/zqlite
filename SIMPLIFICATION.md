# zqlite Simplification Checklist

## âœ… Things You Can Remove/Simplify for Cipher DNS

### 1. **Remove Encryption Module** (Optional Security)
The encryption module in `src/db/encryption.zig` is optional for DNS use cases. DNS data is typically not encrypted at rest.

**To remove:**
- Delete `src/db/encryption.zig`
- Remove encryption import from `src/zqlite.zig`
- Remove encryption features from CLI

### 2. **Simplify CLI Shell** (If not needed)
If you're embedding zqlite in Cipher and don't need the interactive shell:

**To remove:**
- Delete `src/shell/cli.zig` 
- Simplify `src/main.zig` to only include library functions
- Remove shell commands from build.zig

### 3. **Remove Advanced SQL Features** (Keep it minimal)
For DNS use, you mainly need:
- CREATE TABLE
- INSERT 
- SELECT
- UPDATE (for dynamic DNS)
- DELETE

**Optional to remove:**
- Complex WHERE clauses with multiple conditions
- JOINs (not needed for DNS)
- GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
- Advanced indexing features

### 4. **Simplify WAL** (Optional for DNS)
For read-heavy DNS workloads, you might prefer simpler persistence:

**Options:**
- Keep WAL for write-heavy zones (dynamic DNS)
- Remove WAL for read-only authoritative zones
- Use in-memory + periodic dumps for caching

### 5. **Remove Prepared Statements** (If not needed)
DNS queries are usually simple and can use direct SQL execution.

## ðŸš€ Recommended Minimal Configuration for Cipher

### Core Features to Keep:
- âœ… B-tree storage (`src/db/btree.zig`)
- âœ… Basic SQL parser (`src/parser/`)
- âœ… Connection management (`src/db/connection.zig`) 
- âœ… Virtual machine (`src/executor/vm.zig`)
- âœ… Storage engine (`src/db/storage.zig`)

### Optional Features:
- ðŸ”§ WAL (keep for write-heavy scenarios)
- ðŸ”§ Encryption (remove for DNS - not typically needed)
- ðŸ”§ CLI shell (remove if only embedding)
- ðŸ”§ Complex SQL features (keep minimal set)

### Suggested File Size Reduction:
```bash
# Before optimization: ~15 files, ~2000 lines
# After optimization: ~10 files, ~1500 lines

# Remove encryption
rm src/db/encryption.zig

# Simplify CLI (optional)
# rm src/shell/cli.zig

# Simplify main.zig to library-only mode
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Result: Ultra-Lightweight DNS Backend

After simplification:
- **Faster compilation** (fewer files)
- **Smaller binary** (removed unused features) 
- **Easier debugging** (less code to maintain)
- **Perfect for embedding** in Cipher DNS server

The core database functionality remains 100% intact for DNS operations while removing enterprise features you don't need for a high-performance authoritative DNS server.

## ðŸ”„ Easy Toggle Back

All removed features can be easily re-added later if needed. The modular design makes it simple to enable/disable components based on your requirements.

For Cipher DNS, the optimized zqlite provides everything you need:
- Fast DNS record storage and retrieval
- Zone management
- Dynamic DNS updates  
- High-performance authoritative lookups
- Simple integration with zigDNS resolver

Perfect foundation for your all-in-one DNS server! ðŸš€
